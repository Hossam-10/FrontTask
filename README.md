# FrontTask

Updated notes:
1-If you refresh the website after login you won't find user information
because there's no API to return the user data I need this API to.

2-User's create API is broken it returns server error therefore I can't do the
review and feedback part cause I have only one user and I need multiple users.

This Project is made by Nuxt.js (It's a Vue.js framework provides useful features) I used it to save more time.

Pages contains the components that can be accessed, Nuxt.js handles the routing part.

Vuex part will be found in store folder.

Global configs of the app in nuxt.config.js file.
